Installation
============

The section contains a guide for how to install the software neccesary to run the script and execute the experiments. The install is divided into individual section for each piece of software. This guide is assuming you are building on Ubuntu 16.04 or never. The guide will likely not change much for other distributions. If you follow this guide it will install all software packages needed under under an folder named 'software' and copies of all the source code in a folder named 'repositories'
