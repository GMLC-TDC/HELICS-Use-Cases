# GridLAB-D Feeder Model Modification Scripts

## NOTE: This Guide will be updated in the near future ##

This repository contains python scripts that can convert GridLAB-D power flow models (like the [Taxonomy of Prototypical Feeders]( https://github.com/gridlab-d/Taxonomy_Feeders)) to add different technologies.

The repository is structured in the following way:
* modelDependency folder holds any dependencies for the model being created (weather profiles, shedules, etc.)
* modificationScripts folder holds the main script functions for adding technology along with a folder for support function

The code is designed such that nearly all settings can be redefined in the main scripts located in ```./modificationScripts```. For ease of use and example called ```populateFeeders.py``` is present in this folder that creates a user defined number of feeder. Wihtout modification this script will create the new feeders and any support files needed in ```./experiments/<experiment name>```
